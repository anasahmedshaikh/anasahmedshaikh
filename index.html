                <h3>Launching a credit marketplace in Canada</h3>
                <p>Adapting a successful UK credit and report app (20+ million users) for the Canadian market. My role involved leading in-depth user interviews and usability testing in Toronto. These efforts were aimed at gathering critical insights on usability, functionality, and overall user experience. Through this process, I identified and addressed key market-specific challenges, ensuring the app&#8217;s interface and features resonated well with Canadian users. This initiative not only tailored the app to a new audience but also set a strong foundation for its success in Canada.</p>

                <h3>Build your own bank</h3>
                <p>I led the product design team for a cross-platform banking application enabling financial institutions to customize and deploy their own solutions. As the first design hire, I hired and managed a team of 11, directly contributing to key features across iOS, Android, and web platforms. Our work allowed banks to easily select functionalities like current accounts, loans, and cards, mirroring the flexibility of services like Squarespace.</p>

                <h3>Investment insights with TikTok-style short videos</h3>
                <p>Partnering closely with the founders of an early-stage startup to enhance the user experience and interface of an innovative app designed for Gen Z investors. My role was to develop a comprehensive design system and refine the UX/UI, which had been primarily founder-led up until that point. The app delivers investment insights through TikTok-style short videos, appealing directly to the preferences of a younger audience. I ensured that the platform was both engaging and intuitive, facilitating a seamless user journey that aligns with the quick consumption habits of Gen Z.</p>

                <h3>Simplifying crypto trading for beginners</h3>
                <p>As Head of Design at Ziglu, the first crypto app to hold regulatory registration in both the UK and Europe, I developed the complete design system and led a focused team to create an intuitive app that democratises cryptocurrency trading. Our mission was to make the complex world of crypto accessible to the mass market. The app combines cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange trading alongside traditional banking in one user-friendly platform. This approach not only attracted over 100,000 users within months of launch but also earned us the UX/UI Award at the CryptoAM Awards.</p>

                <h3>AI-powered platform to accelerate research</h3>
                <p>Joining the Machine Discovery team to enhance their engineering simulation platform across two sprints. Initially, I developed a foundational UI kit aligned with new branding to standardise and refresh existing interface elements. In the second sprint, I focused on improving the core functionality and key screens of the app, significantly elevating the user experience and ensuring the platform's interface was both intuitive and visually coherent.</p>

                <p>Collaborating with the founder and product manager at Fitmate, a startup dedicated to motivational coaching for weight loss. I was integral in shaping the initial concept and transforming it into a functional prototype. After extensive user testing, we refined the app further to enhance user experience. Our efforts culminated in a successful launch in the App Store, providing users with personalised coaching to help them adhere to their weight loss plans.</p>

This involved creating a unified design system.
